# Central

Central is a centralized library of python program fragments.

Compared to normal libraries that provide the methods to create functionality, central comes with entire program fragments, including the underlying methods.

It is the aim of the Central library to cause any script created with central to eventually be integrated into the library itself.

Due to the design methodology behind the project it is currently
only used for personal automation tools.
